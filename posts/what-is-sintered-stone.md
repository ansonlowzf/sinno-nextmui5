Engineered stone is always evolving. Technology is getting more advanced every year. People always seek a better stone material solution for their home improvement application.

We use natural stone such as granite and marble for kitchen top, wall cladding and flooring before inventing the engineered stone.

However, granite and marble are vulnerable to food colouring stains. Marble is crackable, scratchable and also chip-off due to thermal expansion.

Marble requires to apply the sealant to extend the durability and functionality every few years.

Hence, the quartz surface was invented in 1960 to provide a better stone material solution, which no sealant and maintenance are required.

Quartz surface covers up most of the disadvantages of natural stones. But, it also created another problem.

The resin used to bond the quartz surface ingredients will cause discolouration if exposed to direct sunlight (UV Ray). The colour of the quartz surface might become lighter.

Anyhow, It's still a perfect stone solution for the indoor countertop, especially for kitchen top application. Because its:-

- Acid-resistance
- Bacteria-resistance (Non-porous material)
- Chemical-resistance (Household cleaning product)
- Crack-resistance (Resin bond it)
- Durable (10 years warranty)
- Heat-resistance (Up to 200°C)
- Many colours and shades options
- No surface defect (Like natural stone)
- Non-porous material (0.02% water absorption rate)
- Scratch-resistant (Mohs Hardness rated 7)
- Stain-resistance (0.02% water absorption rate)
- Zero maintenance (No sealant or polish needed)

The sintered stone was invented around 2012 to provide an even better solution.

Sintered stone has all the quartz stone benefits shown above but with higher heat-resistance up to 300°C.

It's invulnerable to sunlight (UV Ray) and can be used for outdoor purposes like porcelain tiles we often use.

Since it looks like porcelain and some manufacturing technologies are overlapping, people often call it porcelain slab. Some companies called it an ultra-compact stone or compact stone.

Is the sintered stone the perfect stone solution for home improvement application?

Still, the sintered stone has its disadvantages. It's hard to fabricate. Hence it required a special cutter, and knowledge to do so.

The main concern of using sintered stone is crackable if hit by a heavy item fall from a 4 feet height. Unlike quartz stone or solid surface, they just dented.

Secondly, the sintered stone polished finish is too reflective. Just wipe with a cloth and clean water also, we might still see the dried watermark.

That's why the matt finish sintered stone is more popular in the market.
