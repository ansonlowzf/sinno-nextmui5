Engineered stone constantly evolving. Technology getting more advance every year. People always seek better stone material solutions for their home improvement applications.

Before inventing the engineered stone, we use natural stones such as granite and marble for kitchen top, wall cladding, and flooring.

The quartz surface was invented in 1960 to provide a better stone surfacing solution, which no sealant and maintenance is required.

Quartz surface covers up most of the disadvantages of natural stones. But, it also has a weakness.

The resin that bonds the quartz surface ingredients will cause discolouration if exposed to direct sunlight (UV Ray). The colour of the quartz surface might become lighter or darker.

Anyhow, It's still a perfect stone solution for the indoor countertop, especially for kitchen top application. Because it's:-

- Acid-resistance
- Bacteria-resistance (Non-porous material)
- Chemical-resistance (Household cleaning product)
- Consistent colour for large application
- Crack-resistance (Resin bond it)
- Durable (10 years warranty)
- Heat-resistance (Up to 200°C)
- Many patterns, colours and shades options
- No surface defect (Like natural stone)
- Non-porous material (0.02% water absorption rate)
- Scratch-resistant (Mohs Hardness rated 7)
- Stain-resistance (0.02% water absorption rate)
- Zero maintenance (No sealant or polish needed)

The sintered stone was invented around 2012 (to be confirmed, no information available yet) to provide an even better solution.

Sintered stone has all the quartz stone benefits shown above but with higher heat resistance up to 300°C.

It's invulnerable to sunlight (UV Ray) and can use for outdoor purposes like porcelain tiles we often use.

Since it looks like porcelain and some manufacturing technologies are overlapping, people often called it porcelain slab. Some companies called it an ultra-compact stone or compact stone.

Is the sintered stone the perfect stone solution for home improvement applications?

Still, the sintered stone has its disadvantages.

The main concern of using sintered stone is crackable if hit by a heavy item fall from a 4 feet height, unlike quartz stone which is just dent or chip-off and still repairable. Repairing cracked sintered stone is very expensive.

Shall you use quartz stone or sintered stone?

For the indoor kitchen, there is no good or bad using quartz stone or sintered stone. Both stone materials eliminate 98% of your hassle using as a kitchen top. Choose the one your home chef like the most. It'll increase the happiness of cooking in the kitchen.
