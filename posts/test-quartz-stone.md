2. It's scratchable.
3. It's a little bit less stain resistance.
4. Less heat resistance
5. It looks perfect without defect. (stone printing technology)

It's one kind of quartz stone but less capable. Do you think people will still buy it after listening to the disadvantages?

If you translate the sticker, it stated this quartz stone is using some kinds of nano-technology, quality is a diamond grade, stain and crack resistant.

It is with ISO some more.

Let's test and see.

We are using industry chemical to do the test. It might corrode our skin. May cause intense smell smoke. And if the quality is too bad, the chemical liquid might bounce also.

Hence, we recommend using this household cleaning liquid to perform the test. You can buy it in any supermarket.

Must use this black colour bottle. Others do not have any effect.

The chemical reaction is slower and lighter, but it is safer.

Drip a drop of Harpic Black on the quartz stone you want to test.

Wait and see, if it starts bubbling means there is a chemical reaction.

After wiping out the Harpic:-
