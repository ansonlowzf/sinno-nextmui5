## Solid Surface

### Pros

#### Seamless joints

The seams are either invisible or hard to be seen by human eyes.

#### Restorable

We can repair and polish the solid surface and reuse it.

### Cons

#### Vulnerable to the chemical

Some strong chemicals such as lacquer, nail colour remover, or corrosive cleaner might discolour the surface.

#### Afraid of acid

Low PHs Foods or dishwashing liquid may dim the colour.

#### Scratches

Even if you use it carefully, the minor scratches will still appear without any clue.

#### Breed bacteria

Scratches breed bacteria, especially if it touches meat.

#### Not resistant to heat

Never put a hot pot on the surface. It might dim the colour. Excessive heat will cause the solid surface to change shape.

### Pros

#### Wood design enthusiast

If you are one of them, I donâ€™t think you need to have a second thought to choose other material.

### Cons

Not suitable to be used in the moisture environment especially the dishwashing area.

#### Breed mildew

Contact with food and water cause the mould colony to grow and infest. Have you ever wondered what those black lumps are? It's mouldy.

#### Breed bacteria

It's a bacteria's sweet home to grow with their best friend - mould.

#### Termites

Might be a victim of termites.

#### Peel-off

Water will penetrate and soften the surface and cause it to peel off.

Non-porous also means no room on the surface for mildew or bacteria to grow.

Quartz stone can resist heat up to 150 degree celsius.

#### Easy to Maintain

Quartz stone requests a minimum effect of maintenance and never needs to apply any sealant every few years to protect the surface.

#### Warranty

Ten years of limited warranty on material, warranty on discolouration, crack without impact, chip-off without impact and mildew grows on the surface.
