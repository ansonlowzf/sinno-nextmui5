## New Composition Stone - Sintered Stone

Engineered stone constantly evolving. Technology getting more advance every year. People always seek better stone materials and solutions for home improvement applications.

Sintered stone is one of the newer stone inventions. It uses sintering technology (compression), heat and pressure to form a solid stone material.

Hence, it's very tough. The toughest stone surfacing material so far.

## Know Quartz Stone To Better Know The Sintered Stone

Before inventing the engineered stone, we used natural stones for surfacing and decorating applications.

The quartz surface was invented in 1960 to provide a better stone surfacing solution. It doesn't need to apply sealant every year to extend the lifespan, and it also doesn't need hassle maintenance to keep it beautiful. Quartz surface covers up most of the disadvantages of natural stones. But, it also has a weakness.

The resin that bonds the quartz surface ingredients will cause discolouration if exposed to direct sunlight (UV Ray). The UV light will speed up the fair wear and tear process, and the quartz stone will become lighter or darker faster than usual.

Anyhow, It's still a perfect stone solution for the indoor countertop, especially for kitchen top application. Because its:-

- Acid-resistance
- Bacteria-resistance (Non-porous material)
- Chemical-resistance (Household cleaning product)
- Consistent colour for large application
- Crack-resistance (Resin bond it)
- Durable (10 years warranty)
- Heat-resistance (Up to 200Â°C)
- Many patterns, colours and shades options
- No surface defect (Like natural stone)
- Non-porous material (0.02% water absorption rate)
- Scratch-resistant (Mohs Hardness rated 7)
- Stain-resistance (0.02% water absorption rate)
- Zero maintenance (No sealant or polish needed)

## Is there a better solution to cover up the UV light weakness?

The sintered stone was invented around 2012 (to be confirmed, no information available yet) to provide a better solution.

Sintered stone has all the quartz stone advantages above and It's invulnerable to sunlight (UV Ray) and can use for outdoor purposes like porcelain tiles we often use.

Since it looks like porcelain and some manufacturing technologies are overlapping, people often call it porcelain slab. Some companies call it an ultra-compact stone or compact stone.

We name it Moca Compact stone [link]

## The sintered stone heat resistance

Sintered stone can resist heat up to 300 degree celsius.

## Is the sintered stone the perfect stone solution?

Still, the sintered stone has a disadvantage.

It is too hard.

The main concern of using sintered stone is crackable if hit by a heavy item fall from a 4 feet height, unlike quartz stone which is just dent or scratch which still repairable.

There is no way to repair a cracked sintered stone. Even glue it back, and you can still see the glue line very obvious.

## Conclusion

Shall you use quartz stone or sintered stone?

For the indoor kitchen, there is no good or bad using quartz stone or sintered stone.

Both stone materials eliminate 98% of your hassle using as a kitchen top. You should choose the colours, shades, textures, and finishes you like the most for your kitchen top.

For outdoor purposes, go sintered stone.
