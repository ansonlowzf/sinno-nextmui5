This slightly textured finish conjures up the emotional caress of stone; adding warmth to the grain so it’s pleasing to the touch. A satin sheen that gently reflects light – captivating the viewer and enhancing the depth of a color, especially on darker shades. Our new Natural Finish combines the appeal of texture one can actually feel – with the practicality of the minimal care and maintenance synonymous with all Caesarstone products.

### Polished
