People often ask, what is the difference between these 2 types of stone? Why shall we choose one over the other?

The stone discussion below is for kitchen top only.

Natural stone for the kitchen top, we have granite whereas engineered stone there are quartz stone and sintered stone

One of the main reasons homeowners choose stone for kitchen top is high heat resistance characteristic.

**Heat Resistance**

- Granite resists up to 250°C.
- Quartz stone resists up to 200°C.
- Sintered stone resists up to 300°C.

**Scratch Resistance**

We move cooking utensils a lot on the stone surface. Scratch resistance is another important factor we choose the stone.

To know scratch resistance, you need to know the Mohs Hardness Scale.

The higher the mineral, the higher the mineral can resist to scratch.

- Granite is scale 6
- Quartz stone is scale 7
- Sintered stone is scale 6

The steel knife is scale 5.5. If a knife cannot scratch the surface of granite, quartz stone, and sintered stone, how can other kitchen utensils with a lower scale could scratch the surface? E.g. Glass, plate, pot, fork, spoon and others.

**Non-porous material**

The lower the water absorption rate, the harder the water can penetrate the surface especially food colour liquid.

Granite's water absorption is 0.4%.
Quartz stone is 0.05%.
Sintered stone is 0.02%.

Engineered stone porous is too small until water is having a difficult time to penetrate. Hence, engineered stone is established as non-porous material.

What is porous?

Porous is the tiny hole on the surface which human eyes cannot see, but water can penetrate it. Imagine the appearance of an orange, every stone surface also has those tiny holes but we can’t see it.

**Stain Resistance**

The higher the water absorption rate, the faster the food colouring liquid can penetrate the surface. If turmeric colouring penetrates the surface, no way we can remove the colour mark. This is called permanent stain.

**Bacteria have no room to grow their colony**

Non-porous material is very important, especially the surface for food preparation. The hole is too tiny for bacteria to grow.

Feel free to knead the dough or other food preparation directly on the surface.

**Easy to clean**

Non-porous is like a layer of protection on the surface; a cloth with water is more than enough to clean the sticky oil, egg yolk and dried food.

**Zero maintenance**

Granite also can last longer than usual if applied nano sealant to protect from heavy colouring stain.

Quartz stone or sintered stone does not require any sealant or wax.

**Pricing**

It depends on colour and shades. People always think that granite is cheap stone. However, Granite also has a luxury collection which cost higher price than quartz stone and sintered stone. Natural stone and engineered also have economical, medium and luxury collections.

**Conclusion**

The benefits of granite, quart stone and sintered stone are very close. Just choose the colour and shades you like the most for your home kitchen top.
