## Easy Maintenance

We supply genuine the engineered stones (Quartz stone, Ultra-Compact Stone, Sintered Stone) which are non-porous material. Most of the time, you just need to wipe your quartz stone product's surface with a soft cloth and water.

## Cleaning Method

- Cleaning with clean water and a soft cloth is already good to keep the product look nice and durable.
- If needed, just apply non-abrasive gel such as Soft Scrub Liquid Gel with Bleach, “CIF” cleaning cream, or any cleaning pledge and rub gently in circle direction with a soft cloth, it will make the product shine beautifully.
